Visma Solutions - programming task

Description:

  I understood the problem as building a class URI parser which returns the path and parameters relating to the URI.
I tried to make the class first in TypeScript but faced some problems early on, the searchParams were not iterable and the people's hints
who faced a similar issue online, didn't help me resolve the issue so I changed to a JavaScript implementation.
I also did some basic error checking by console.erroring some of the issues that there might be. 

I would definitely make better error handling and descriptions but that would require knowledge about how the rest of the programs that use the class implementation would want to handle the errors.
